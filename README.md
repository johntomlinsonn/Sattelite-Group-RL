# Traffic-Signal-Controller-Deep-Learning
Traffic Signal Control with Reinforcement Learning Optimize urban traffic flow using reinforcement learning and SUMO simulation. This project connects Python, TraCI, and PyTorch to train an RL agent that controls traffic lights to reduce congestion. Includes setup instructions, tutorials, and custom RL environment integration.
