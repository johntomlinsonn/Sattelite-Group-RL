# README: Satellite Swarm Coordination via Deep Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Project Title

Satellite Swarm Coordination via Deep Reinforcement Learning

## 2. Introduction and Abstract

This project investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the problem of coordinating a swarm of satellites for optimal Earth coverage or communication quality. The objective is to develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system where individual satellite agents learn decentralized positioning strategies to achieve a collective global objective. This endeavor addresses significant challenges in distributed optimization, decentralized control, and real-time decision-making for complex multi-agent systems, such as large-scale satellite constellations. The project utilizes PyTorch for the implementation of deep neural networks within the reinforcement learning framework.

## 3. Core Concepts

This project is built upon the following fundamental concepts:

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. The learning process involves trial and error, where the agent observes states, takes actions, receives rewards, and transitions to new states.

* **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL):** An advanced form of RL that integrates deep neural networks to approximate value functions or policies. This enables RL algorithms to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, which are characteristic of complex real-world problems.

* **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):** An extension of RL to scenarios involving multiple interacting agents within a shared environment. The challenges in MARL include credit assignment, non-stationarity of the environment from an individual agent's perspective, and the curse of dimensionality.

  * **Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE):** A prominent paradigm in MARL where agents are trained collectively using global state information, but during execution, each agent acts independently based on its local observations. This approach mitigates issues like non-stationarity during training while allowing for scalable deployment.

  * **Cooperative MARL:** A specific type of MARL where all agents share a common goal and a single, global reward function, necessitating collaborative behavior.

* **PyTorch:** An open-source machine learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is widely used for deep learning applications due to its flexibility, dynamic computation graph, and strong GPU acceleration support.

## 4. Simulation Environment Design

A custom simulation environment will be developed to model the satellite swarm and the Earth.

### 4.1. State Space Definition

The state observed by each satellite agent will encompass critical information for decision-making:

* **Own Satellite State:**

  * Current 2D/3D position (e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude, or Cartesian coordinates $x, y, z$).

  * Current velocity vector (if dynamic movement is considered).

* **Other Satellite States (Partial/Full Observability):**

  * Relative positions and velocities of neighboring satellites within a defined communication or sensing radius.

  * The number of other satellites currently within line-of-sight or communication range.

* **Earth Coverage Information:**

  * Coverage status of predefined target areas on the Earth's surface (e.g., a discretized grid of points, indicating whether each point is covered by at least one satellite).

  * Quantitative assessment of signal quality or coverage strength at various points on Earth.

* **Time:** The elapsed simulation time, which may influence orbital dynamics or mission phases.

### 4.2. Action Space Definition

The actions available to each satellite agent will dictate its movement and positioning strategy:

* **Discrete Actions (for simplified models):**

  * Translational movements (e.g., move North, South, East, West in a 2D grid).

  * Altitude adjustments (e.g., Increase Altitude, Decrease Altitude).

  * Maintain current position.

* **Continuous Actions (for more realistic models):**

  * Thrust vectors (e.g., $\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z$ representing changes in velocity components).

  * Direct target position coordinates (if the environment handles the intermediate trajectory).

### 4.3. Reward Function Formulation

The reward function is meticulously designed to guide the agents towards the desired cooperative behavior:

* **Primary Reward (Cooperative Objective):**

  * Maximization of total Earth coverage: This is typically represented as the sum of coverage quality values over all target points on Earth, or the number of unique target points covered above a threshold.

  * Minimization of coverage overlap: Penalties for redundant coverage in areas already sufficiently covered by other satellites.

  * Maintenance of communication links: Positive rewards for establishing and sustaining inter-satellite or satellite-to-ground communication links, with penalties for dropped connections.

* **Secondary Rewards/Penalties:**

  * Energy consumption penalty: A negative reward proportional to the energy expended for propulsion or maneuvers.

  * Collision avoidance penalty: Significant negative rewards for proximity to or actual collisions with other satellites.

  * Proximity to desired orbital parameters: Rewards for maintaining satellites within predefined orbital zones or trajectories.

### 4.4. Environmental Dynamics

The simulation will incorporate simplified dynamics:

* **Simple 2D Grid Simulation:** Satellites operate on a 2D grid, representing a flattened Earth surface or a simplified orbital plane. Movement is characterized by discrete steps.

* **Continuous 2D/3D Simulation:** Satellites move in a continuous space, governed by simplified physics models (e.g., constant velocity, or basic approximations of orbital mechanics, such as Keplerian orbits without perturbations). While PyBullet offers advanced physics, a custom simulation might be initially preferred for its simplicity and direct control over specific dynamics.

## 5. Reinforcement Learning Approach

### 5.1. Choice of RL Algorithm

Considering the multi-agent, cooperative nature of the problem, the following algorithms are suitable:

* **Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG):** This algorithm is recommended as a starting point due to its proven effectiveness in cooperative MARL settings, particularly with continuous action spaces. MADDPG extends the DDPG framework by employing a CTDE approach, where each agent possesses its own actor and critic networks, but the critic leverages global observations and actions during training to stabilize learning.

* **Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) / Multi-Agent Advantage Actor-Critic (MAA2C):** These are on-policy algorithms that can be adapted for multi-agent environments. They are often simpler to implement than MADDPG but may require a larger number of environmental samples for convergence.

* **Value Decomposition Networks (VDN) / QMIX:** These approaches are specifically designed for cooperative tasks where a global Q-value function can be additively or non-linearly decomposed into individual agent Q-values, simplifying credit assignment.

### 5.2. Neural Network Architecture

For each agent (assuming MADDPG implementation):

* **Actor Network:**

  * **Input:** The agent's local observation (state).

  * **Output:** A continuous action vector (e.g., thrust values) or probability distributions over discrete actions.

  * **Architecture:** Typically a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions in hidden layers, and a `tanh` activation for continuous action outputs to bound them.

* **Critic Network:**

  * **Input:** A concatenation of all agents' states (global observation) and all agents' actions.

  * **Output:** A single scalar Q-value representing the estimated value of the given global state-action pair.

  * **Architecture:** An MLP with ReLU activations in hidden layers.

### 5.3. Training Process

The training process will follow standard DRL procedures adapted for MARL:

1. **Initialization:** Initialize all actor and critic networks for each agent, along with their corresponding target networks.

2. **Experience Replay Buffer:** A shared or individual experience replay buffer (`collections.deque`) will be used to store transitions ($s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}$) for off-policy learning, enabling efficient sample utilization.

3. **Episode Simulation:**

   * At each time step within an episode, each agent observes its current state and selects an action using its actor network. Exploration noise (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for continuous actions) is added to encourage exploration.

   * The environment simulates the satellite movements based on the collective actions of all agents.

   * Rewards are calculated based on the reward function and observed by the agents.

   * The resulting transitions (current state, action, reward, next state) are stored in the replay buffer.

4. **Network Updates:**

   * Periodically, mini-batches of transitions are sampled from the replay buffer.

   * **Critic Network Update:** The critic networks are updated by minimizing a loss function, typically the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values (calculated using the target networks).

   * **Actor Network Update:** The actor networks are updated to maximize the expected return, which is achieved by maximizing the Q-value output by the critic for the actions chosen by the actor.

   * **Target Network Updates:** Target networks (slowly updated copies of the main networks) are used to provide stable Q-value targets, typically updated via soft updates (e.g., Polyak averaging).

## 6. Implementation Details (PyTorch Specific)

The project will leverage PyTorch's capabilities for efficient deep learning:

* **PyTorch Modules:** Actor and Critic networks will be defined as subclasses of `torch.nn.Module`, allowing for structured network definitions and easy parameter management.

* **Optimizers:** The `torch.optim.Adam` optimizer will be employed for both actor and critic networks due to its efficiency and good performance in a wide range of deep learning tasks.

* **Loss Functions:**

  * **Critic Loss:** `torch.nn.MSELoss` (Mean Squared Error) will be used to quantify the difference between predicted and target Q-values.

  * **Actor Loss:** The actor's loss will be formulated to maximize the Q-value, often implemented as the negative mean of the Q-values predicted by the critic for the actor's chosen actions.

* **Data Structures:**

  * `collections.deque` will serve as the foundation for the experience replay buffer, providing efficient append and pop operations.

  * All data inputs and outputs for the neural networks will be handled as `torch.Tensor` objects, enabling seamless integration with PyTorch's computational graph.

* **GPU Acceleration:** The implementation will include support for GPU acceleration (`.cuda()`) to significantly speed up training processes, provided a compatible GPU is available.

## 7. Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the satellite swarm coordination system will be evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Total Earth Coverage:** The percentage of target areas on Earth that are covered above a specified quality threshold.

* **Communication Link Stability:** The percentage of simulation time during which critical communication links (inter-satellite or satellite-to-ground) are maintained.

* **Reward per Episode:** The average cumulative reward accumulated by the swarm over the course of each training episode, indicating learning progress.

* **Convergence Rate:** The speed at which the learning algorithm reaches a stable and optimal policy.

* **Energy Efficiency:** The total energy consumed (e.g., proportional to thrust applied) per episode, reflecting the cost-effectiveness of the learned policies.

## 8. Project Phases and Milestones
